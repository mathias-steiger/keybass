This script plays a bass sound on every keypress (not release), except if
you press them simultaneously within 10ms. Not the perfect solution, but
it works satisfactory.

You can easily output the sounds only on your secondary sound output (card)
with aplay. Ideal to annoy your neighbours with random deep bass sounds
while you are wearing your headphones and are just enjoying the bass 
vibrations. The sample is pitched down and sounds a lot better on high-
quality speakers.
